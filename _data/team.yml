      Fasil Tesema is a researcher specializing in space physics, with a focus on ionospheric studies and magnetospheric dynamics. His extensive research covers areas such as ionospheric irregularities, pulsating auroras, and space weather. Fasil earned his MSc in space physics from Bahir Dar University in Ethiopia and completed his PhD at the Arctic Geophysics Department at the University Centre in Svalbard in 2021. Between 2022 and 2024, he worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki, focusing on magnetospheric dynamics through simulations. As a member of the DynaMIT team, he will play a significant role in developing the LOMPE technique.
    # Fasil did a PhD in space physics at UNIS (Svalbard, Norway) between 2018 and 2021, and a post-doc at the University of Helsinki in 2022-2024. 
    # Say how he contributes to DynaMIT

      Margot completed her PhD at the University of Bergen under the supervision of Karl M. Laundal, graduating in June 2024.
      She has now started a PRODEX project. As part of the DynaMIT team, Margot will further develop the Local mapping of polar ionospheric electrodynamics (Lompe) technique for use in Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) and demonstrate its capabilities across three scenarios related to potential and upcoming ESA missions.
