### **How is Earth's atmosphere dynamically coupled to space?**

The DynaMIT project challenges the long-held assumption that the ionosphere is in a steady state. This static view limits our ability to fully understand the intricate interplay between the atmosphere and space plasma and resulting phenomena such as the aurora. 

DynaMIT takes a dynamic approach to magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling. Using first principles, we model the interactions between the neutral atmosphere, plasma, and electromagnetic fields.
