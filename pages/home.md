### **How is Earth's atmosphere dynamically coupled to space?**

DynaMIT is an ERC-funded project that explores the dynamic coupling between Earthâ€™s atmosphere and space. We move beyond traditional steady-state electric circuit models, which limit our understanding of the complex interplay between the atmosphere, space plasma, and phenomena such as the aurora.

DynaMIT takes a dynamic, first-principles approach to magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling, modeling the interactions between the neutral atmosphere, plasma, and electromagnetic fields. By advancing our theoretical understanding, we also aim to better interpret observational data and uncover the physical mechanisms behind the variability we observe in near-Earth space.
