Ground magnetic field variations have been used to investigate ionospheric dynamics for more than a century. They are usually explained in terms of an electric circuit in the ionosphere driven by an electric field, but this is insufficient to explain how magnetic field disturbances are dynamically established. In a recently published paper we explain and simulate how the ionosphere dynamically responds to magnetospheric forcing and how it leads to magnetic field deformation via Faraday's law. Our approach underscores the causal relationships, treating the magnetic field and velocity as primary variables (the B, v paradigm), whereas the electric field and current are derived, in contrast to the E, j paradigm commonly used in ionospheric physics.
