This week, the DynaMIT team gathered with external collaborators and students for a kick-off meeting to review the progress of the project and set our future direction.

We discussed the current status of DynaMIT and reviewed our achievements to date. Our primary focus was on outlining future goals, including key publication pathways and improvements to the project's simulation code. Additionally, we examined the current status of the Lompe technique, explored potential code improvements, and addressed its limitations and challenges. Several related projects utilizing Lompe were also presented. Among such presentations:
-Heikki: GIC presentation (recent paper by Liisa Juusola)
-Margot: OSSE (Observing System Simulation Experiment) approach
-Jens Christian (PhD student) and Spencer: TREX and Lompe
-Jesper: The ARCH project

Our external collaborators and PhD students also gave insightful presentations on their respective projects and how their work aligns with DynaMIT’s objectives, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of the project. Here's a summary of such presentations: 
-Jens Christian: Observational assessment of quiet auroral arc generator theories via data assimilation techniques 
-Sara (PhD student), mesoscale analyses [ask title of her presentation] 
-Spencer, EISCAT3D (e3doubt, 3d reconstruction, future plans/status of project)
-Heikki, the JOIN project (ESA)

We also received updates on the EZIE mission. 

The meeting gave us a clearer vision for the upcoming phases, and we’re excited to keep making progress with the support of our team and partners.

The next meeting is planned for February 2025...
