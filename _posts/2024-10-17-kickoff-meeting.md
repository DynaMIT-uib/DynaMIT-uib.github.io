This week, the DynaMIT team gathered with external collaborators and students for a kick-off meeting to review the progress of the project and set our future direction.

We discussed the current status of DynaMIT and reviewed our achievements to date. Our primary focus was on outlining future goals, including key publication pathways and improvements to the project's simulation code. 

Additionally, we examined the current status of the Lompe technique, explored potential code improvements, and addressed its limitations and challenges. Several related projects utilizing Lompe were also presented. Among such presentations:
- Heikki: GIC presentation (recent paper by Liisa Juusola)
- Margot: Lompe and Observing System Simulation Experiments
- Jens C. Hessen (PhD student) and Spencer: TREX and Lompe
- Jesper: The ARCH project

Our external collaborators and PhD students also gave insightful presentations on their respective projects and how their work aligns with DynaMIT’s objectives, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of the project. 
- Jens C.: Observational assessment of quiet auroral arc generator theories via data assimilation techniques 
- Sara Gasparini (PhD student): mesoscale analyses
- Spencer: Status of the EISCAT3D project and future plans (e3doubt, 3d reconstruction, ...)
- Heikki: the JOIN project (ESA)

The meeting gave us a clearer vision for the upcoming phases, and we’re excited to keep making progress with the support of our team and partners.

The next workshop is planned for 3-7 February 2025, and will focus on ...?
